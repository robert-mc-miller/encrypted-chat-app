# encrypted-chat-app
This is a small program I built while learning about sockets, ports and encrytion.

# The idea
The idea is that two people launch the program. One choses to be a 'host' and the other chooses to be a 'guest' the host will share their ip address with the guest and the guest will type in that ip address. If the ip address is correct then each program will share the encryption keys with the other. The users can then send messages back and forth between each other. These messages are encrypted with the public key and decrypted with the private key for each user.
